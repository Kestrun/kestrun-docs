## Step-by-step

1. Register Basic + API Key + JWT schemes.
2. Enable configuration.
3. Map grouped secure routes under `/secure/...`.
4. Start server.

## Try it

Validate each group using its respective header (Basic, X-Api-Key, Bearer token).

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom            | Cause                      | Fix                                |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 401 on one scheme  | Header missing             | Supply correct Authorization / key |
| Overlapping routes | Same path different scheme | Use distinct prefixes              |
