# AppInfo

Display application-wide variables defined in the main server script and shared across runspaces.

## Full source

File: [`pwsh/tutorial/examples/Assets/Pages/AppInfo.cshtml`][Assets/Pages/AppInfo.cshtml]

```razor
{% include examples/pwsh/Assets/Pages/AppInfo.cshtml %}
```

File: [`pwsh/tutorial/examples/Assets/Pages/AppInfo.cshtml.ps1`][Assets/Pages/AppInfo.cshtml.ps1]

```powershell
{% include examples/pwsh/Assets/Pages/AppInfo.cshtml.ps1 %}
```

## Step-by-step

1. Shared state: Define `$AppInfo`, `$FeatureFlags`, and `$Motd` in the main server script before `Enable-KrConfiguration`.
2. Model: Read those variables in `AppInfo.cshtml.ps1`.
3. Host dump: Use `Expand-KrObject` to create a readable snapshot of `$KrServer`.
4. View: Render App details, feature flags, MOTD, and the host dump.

## Try it

```powershell
curl -i http://127.0.0.1:5000/AppInfo
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| App section missing | `$AppInfo` not set or not in scope | Ensure `$AppInfo` is defined in the server script before `Enable-KrConfiguration` |
| Flags are empty | `$FeatureFlags` not set | Define `$FeatureFlags` in the server script and keep it in scope |
| Host dump fails | `Expand-KrObject` unavailable | Ensure the Kestrun module is imported and available to the Razor runspaces |
