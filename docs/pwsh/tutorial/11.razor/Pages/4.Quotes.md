# Quotes

Generate a “quote of the moment” in PowerShell and render it with Razor.

## Full source

File: [`pwsh/tutorial/examples/Assets/Pages/Quotes.cshtml`][Assets/Pages/Quotes.cshtml]

```razor
{% include examples/pwsh/Assets/Pages/Quotes.cshtml %}
```

File: [`pwsh/tutorial/examples/Assets/Pages/Quotes.cshtml.ps1`][Assets/Pages/Quotes.cshtml.ps1]

```powershell
{% include examples/pwsh/Assets/Pages/Quotes.cshtml.ps1 %}
```

## Step-by-step

1. Quote list: Define a small in-memory list of quote/author pairs.
2. Seed: Create a short GUID-based seed for display.
3. Pick: Choose one quote at random.
4. Model: Set `$Model` with `Quote`, `Author`, and `Seed`.
5. Render: Display the quote and encourage refresh to get a new one.

## Try it

```powershell
curl -i http://127.0.0.1:5000/Quotes
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Same quote repeats | Random selection by chance | Refresh a few times or expand the `$quotes` list |
| Razor shows “No quote” | Model not set | Ensure `Quotes.cshtml.ps1` executes and assigns `$Model` |
