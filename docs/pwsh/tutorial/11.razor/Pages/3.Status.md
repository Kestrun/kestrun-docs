# Status

Display request and runtime details by reading `$Context` and passing a formatted model to Razor.

## Full source

File: [`pwsh/tutorial/examples/Assets/Pages/Status.cshtml`][Assets/Pages/Status.cshtml]

```razor
{% include examples/pwsh/Assets/Pages/Status.cshtml %}
```

File: [`pwsh/tutorial/examples/Assets/Pages/Status.cshtml.ps1`][Assets/Pages/Status.cshtml.ps1]

```powershell
{% include examples/pwsh/Assets/Pages/Status.cshtml.ps1 %}
```

## Step-by-step

1. Request: Read `$Context.Request` and the remote IP from `$Context.Connection`.
2. Header subset: Build a small, readable header list.
3. Model: Populate `$Model` with method, path, UTC time, remote IP, and header text.
4. View title: Set `ViewData["Title"]`.
5. Render: Show request details and a header dump.

## Try it

```powershell
curl -i http://127.0.0.1:5000/Status
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Remote IP is blank | Loopback or proxy hides address | This is expected on local runs; configure forwarded headers if behind a proxy |
| Headers section empty | Header keys not present | Update `$keys` in the script to include the headers you’re sending |
