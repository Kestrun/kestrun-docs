# Index

Render the home page and show a model prepared by a sibling PowerShell script.

## Full source

File: [`pwsh/tutorial/examples/Assets/Pages/Index.cshtml`][Assets/Pages/Index.cshtml]

```razor
{% include examples/pwsh/Assets/Pages/Index.cshtml %}
```

File: [`pwsh/tutorial/examples/Assets/Pages/Index.cshtml.ps1`][Assets/Pages/Index.cshtml.ps1]

```powershell
{% include examples/pwsh/Assets/Pages/Index.cshtml.ps1 %}
```

## Step-by-step

1. View title: Set `ViewData["Title"]` for the layout.
2. Model binding: Read `Model.Data` into a dynamic object (`d`).
3. Fallback: Use a default object when no model is available.
4. Render: Show the welcome header and a tagline.
5. Tips list: Render a list of tips when present.

## Try it

```powershell
curl -i http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Page renders “No model” | `Index.cshtml.ps1` not found or not executed | Ensure the sample is started with `Add-KrPowerShellRazorPagesRuntime -RootPath './Assets/Pages'` |
| Layout not applied | `_ViewStart.cshtml` missing or layout path wrong | Confirm `Assets/Pages/_ViewStart.cshtml` sets `Layout = "Shared/_Layout"` |
