# About

Explain the demo and list a few features using a model generated by PowerShell.

## Full source

File: [`pwsh/tutorial/examples/Assets/Pages/About.cshtml`][Assets/Pages/About.cshtml]

```razor
{% include examples/pwsh/Assets/Pages/About.cshtml %}
```

File: [`pwsh/tutorial/examples/Assets/Pages/About.cshtml.ps1`][Assets/Pages/About.cshtml.ps1]

```powershell
{% include examples/pwsh/Assets/Pages/About.cshtml.ps1 %}
```

## Step-by-step

1. View title: Set `ViewData["Title"]` for the layout.
2. Model binding: Read `Model.Data` into `d` and define a fallback shape.
3. Headline: Render the project name from the model.
4. Blurb: Render a one-paragraph explanation.
5. Features list: Iterate over `d.Features` and render each item.

## Try it

```powershell
curl -i http://127.0.0.1:5000/About
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Feature list is empty | `$Model.Features` missing or empty | Ensure `About.cshtml.ps1` returns a `Features` array |
| Razor errors on `foreach` | Model fallback type mismatch | Keep `Features = new string[0]` (or ensure `$Model.Features` is an array of strings) |
