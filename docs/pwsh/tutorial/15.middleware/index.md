# Introduction to Middleware

Middleware in Kestrun are pluggable components that run in the HTTP pipeline to inspect, transform, short‑circuit,
or enrich requests and responses before / after your route handlers execute.

Core goals:

- Composition: Add only what you need (logging, antiforgery, auth, static files, caching, etc.)
- Clarity: PowerShell cmdlets wrap consistent underlying ASP.NET Core services
- Override: Most features can be tuned per route (e.g., disable antiforgery on a JSON echo endpoint)

## Current Status

| Area | Middleware Available | Notes |
|------|----------------------|-------|
| Security | Antiforgery (CSRF), HSTS, HTTPS Redirection | Production ready |
| Static Content | File Server | Directory browse + headers |
| Responses | Caching helpers | Per‑route directives (see Caching chapter) |
| Logging | Sinks / enrichment | See Logging section |
| AuthN/Z | Schemes & policies | See Authentication section |
| Sessions | Session state | New – see Sessions chapter |
| Security | Host Filtering | [Tutorial](./6.Host-Filtering) |
| Upcoming | Rate Limiting | Planned |
| Upcoming | Compression | Planned |
| Security | CORS | [Tutorial](./8.Cors) |

## Quick Start: Antiforgery

Add antiforgery middleware + token endpoint:

```powershell
Add-KrAntiforgeryMiddleware -CookieName '.Kestrun.AntiXSRF' -HeaderName 'X-CSRF-TOKEN'
Add-KrAntiforgeryTokenRoute -Path '/csrf-token' | Out-Null
```

Protects unsafe verbs (POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE). Fetch a token, then send it as a header with the antiforgery cookie.

See the full tutorial: [Antiforgery Protection](./1.Antiforgery)

## Pipeline Order Guidelines

Recommended relative ordering when composing:

1. Logging / correlation
2. Static files / file server
3. Security (Antiforgery, Authentication, Authorization)
4. Caching / response manipulation
5. Routing + handlers (PowerShell / C#/VB)
6. Post‑processing (metrics, custom tail middleware)

## Roadmap & Tracking

Planned middleware will appear here as they are implemented. Contributions welcome (see contributing guide).

| Feature | Status | Tracking |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Antiforgery | ✅ Implemented | Tutorial + Topic Deep Dive (coming) |
| HSTS & HTTPS Redirection | ✅ Implemented | [Tutorial](./4.Https-Hsts) + [Guide](/guides/hsts) |
| Rate Limiting | ⏳ Planned | TBD |
| Compression | ⏳ Planned | TBD |
| CORS | ✅ Implemented | [Tutorial](./8.Cors) + [Guide](/guides/cors) |
| Request Metrics | Ideation | TBD |
