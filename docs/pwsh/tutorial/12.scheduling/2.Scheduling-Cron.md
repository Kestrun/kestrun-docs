# Scheduling with CRON

Run jobs using 6-field CRON expressions with seconds precision.

## Full source

File: [`pwsh/tutorial/examples/12.2-Scheduling-Cron.ps1`][12.2-Scheduling-Cron.ps1]

```powershell
{% include examples/pwsh/12.2-Scheduling-Cron.ps1 %}
```

Notes:

- Use `*/N` in the first field (seconds) for sub-minute cadence.
- Combine PowerShell `ScriptBlock` and inline C# code as needed.
- CRON format: six-field (seconds minutes hours day month day-of-week)

[12.2-Scheduling-Cron.ps1]: /pwsh/tutorial/examples/12.2-Scheduling-Cron.ps1

## Step-by-step

1. Enable the scheduler subsystem.
2. Register a job with a 6-field CRON expression (seconds precision).
3. Mix PowerShell ScriptBlock or inline C# as needed for job bodies.
4. Observe execution over time; adjust timing with CRON fields.

## Try it

```powershell
pwsh .\docs\_includes\examples\pwsh\12.2-Scheduling-Cron.ps1
# Observe logs for scheduled job runs over the next ~30 seconds
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Job not firing | CRON expression invalid | Validate 6-field CRON and test with a short cadence like `*/5 * * * * *` |
| Too frequent or too slow | Misplaced `*/N` field | Ensure seconds field is first and uses `*/N` for sub-minute |
| Overlapping runs | Long-running job | Consider concurrency control or longer intervals |
