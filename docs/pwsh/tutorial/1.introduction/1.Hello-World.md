# Hello World

This sample spins up a small Kestrun server and returns plain text from a single route.

> Prerequisites: see [Introduction][Introduction].

## Full source

File: [`pwsh/tutorial/examples/1.1-Hello-World.ps1`][1.1-Hello-World.ps1]

```powershell
{% include examples/pwsh/1.1-Hello-World.ps1 %}
```

## Step-by-step

1. Server: create the host with [New-KrServer][New-KrServer].
2. Listener: bind to 127.0.0.1:5000 with [Add-KrEndpoint][Add-KrEndpoint].
3. Configure: apply staged changes using [Enable-KrConfiguration][Enable-KrConfiguration].
4. Route: map `GET /hello` via [Add-KrMapRoute][Add-KrMapRoute] with a script block handler.
5. Response: inside the route, call [Write-KrTextResponse][Write-KrTextResponse] to return text/plain with status 200.
6. Start: run the server with [Start-KrServer][Start-KrServer] and stop with Ctrl+C.

### How it works

- Configuration is staged by cmdlets, then committed with [Enable-KrConfiguration][Enable-KrConfiguration].
- Each route runs inside a request context (available as $Context) with Request/Response properties.
- [Write-KrTextResponse][Write-KrTextResponse] is a convenience wrapper that sets Content‑Type to text/plain and writes the body.
- By default, a single listener is configured on 127.0.0.1:5000; you can add more listeners (e.g., HTTPS) later.

## Try it

Save the sample locally so it’s easy to run. Copy the contents of
[`pwsh/tutorial/examples/1.1-Hello-World.ps1`][1.1-Hello-World.ps1]
into a new file in an empty working folder (for example, `hello-world.ps1`), then run:

```powershell
# From your working folder
pwsh .\hello-world.ps1
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/hello
```

PowerShell alternative:

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/hello' | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Content
```

Stop the server with Ctrl+C in the terminal where you ran the script.

## Troubleshooting

- If the port is in use, choose a different port in Add‑KrListener.
