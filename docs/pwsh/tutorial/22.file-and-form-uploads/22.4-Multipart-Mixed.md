# multipart/mixed ordered parts

Parse ordered multipart payloads where part order matters.

## Full source

File: [`pwsh/tutorial/examples/22.4-Multipart-Mixed.ps1`][22.4-Multipart-Mixed.ps1]

```powershell
{% include examples/pwsh/22.4-Multipart-Mixed.ps1 %}
```

## Step-by-step

1. Logger: Enable console logging.
2. Server: Create the host and bind a listener.
3. Storage: Configure a temporary upload directory.
4. Options: Opt in to `multipart/mixed` via `AllowedRequestContentTypes`.
5. Route: Add `/mixed` with `Add-KrFormRoute` and return ordered content types and count.

## Try it

```powershell
$boundary = 'mixed-boundary'
$body = @(
    "--$boundary",
    "Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"text\"",
    "Content-Type: text/plain",
    "",
    "first",
    "--$boundary",
    "Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"json\"",
    "Content-Type: application/json",
    "",
    '{"value":42}',
    "--$boundary--",
    ""
) -join "`r`n"
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/mixed' -ContentType "multipart/mixed; boundary=$boundary" -Body $body
```

```bash
cat > payload.txt <<'EOF'
--mixed-boundary
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="text"
Content-Type: text/plain

first
--mixed-boundary
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="json"
Content-Type: application/json

{"value":42}
--mixed-boundary--
EOF

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=mixed-boundary" --data-binary @payload.txt http://127.0.0.1:5000/mixed
```

## Expected output

```json
{
  "count": 2,
  "contentTypes": ["text/plain", "application/json"]
}
```

## Notes

- Content types: `Add-KrFormRoute` defaults to `multipart/form-data` only; this script opts in to `multipart/mixed`.
- Limits: `MaxParts` constrains how many sections are processed.
- Security: Parts are stored to disk without loading whole bodies into memory.
- Logging: Per-part metadata is logged via `host.Logger`.
- Rules: If you configure `KrPartRule`, include `Content-Disposition: ...; name="..."` so rules can match ordered parts.

## Troubleshooting

- 415 / Unsupported Content-Type: Ensure the request `Content-Type` is `multipart/mixed; boundary=...` and the route options allow it.
- Unexpected part order: For ordered payloads, keep the body exactly in the intended sequence.
