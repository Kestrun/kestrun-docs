# KestrunRuntimeInfo class

Utility class to expose information about the runtime environment that Kestrun was built for, and to gate features by TFM and runtime.

```csharp
public static class KestrunRuntimeInfo
```

## Public Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| static [GetBuiltTargetFrameworkName](KestrunRuntimeInfo/GetBuiltTargetFrameworkName)() | Returns the full target framework name this assembly was built against, e.g., ".NETCoreApp,Version=v9.0". |
| static [GetBuiltTargetFrameworkVersion](KestrunRuntimeInfo/GetBuiltTargetFrameworkVersion)() | Returns the target framework version this assembly was built against as a System.Version (e.g., 8.0, 9.0). |
| static [GetKnownFeatures](KestrunRuntimeInfo/GetKnownFeatures)() | Returns the set of known feature identifiers (enum names) that have a compile-time (TFM) gate registered. This does not guarantee that [`Supports`](./KestrunRuntimeInfo/Supports) will return true, only that the feature is recognized and has a minimum version entry. |
| static [Supports](KestrunRuntimeInfo/Supports)(…) | True if the loaded Kestrun assembly supports the feature, considering both build-time TFM and runtime requirements. (2 methods) |
| static [TryGetMinVersion](KestrunRuntimeInfo/TryGetMinVersion)(…) | Returns the minimum TFM required for a feature, if known. |
| enum [KnownFeature](KestrunRuntimeInfo.KnownFeature) | Built-in Kestrun feature keys. Add more as you gate new APIs by TFM. |
