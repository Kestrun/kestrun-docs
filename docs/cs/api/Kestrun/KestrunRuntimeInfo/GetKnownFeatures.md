# KestrunRuntimeInfo.GetKnownFeatures method

Returns the set of known feature identifiers (enum names) that have a compile-time (TFM) gate registered. This does not guarantee that [`Supports`](./Supports) will return true, only that the feature is recognized and has a minimum version entry.

public static IEnumerable<string> GetKnownFeatures()
```
