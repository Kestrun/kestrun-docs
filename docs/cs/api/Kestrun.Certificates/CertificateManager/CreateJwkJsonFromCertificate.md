# CertificateManager.CreateJwkJsonFromCertificate method

Builds a JWK JSON (RSA) representation of the given certificate. By default only public parameters are included (safe for publishing as JWKS). Set *includePrivateParameters* to true if you want a full private JWK (for local storage only – never publish it).

```csharp
public static string CreateJwkJsonFromCertificate(X509Certificate2 certificate, 
    bool includePrivateParameters = false)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| certificate | The X509 certificate to convert. |
| includePrivateParameters | Whether to include private key parameters in the JWK. |

## Return Value

The JWK JSON string.
