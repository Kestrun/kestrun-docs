## Remarks

The service uses a runspace pool for PowerShell jobs and supports scheduling via cron expressions or intervals. It also provides methods to retrieve task reports in various formats, including typed objects and PowerShell-friendly hashtables.

Initializes a new instance of the [`SchedulerService`](./SchedulerService) class. This constructor sets up the scheduler service with a specified runspace pool, logger, and optional time zone. The runspace pool is used for executing PowerShell scripts, while the logger is used for logging events.
