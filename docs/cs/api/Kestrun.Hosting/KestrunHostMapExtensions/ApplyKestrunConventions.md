# KestrunHostMapExtensions.ApplyKestrunConventions method

Applies the same route conventions used by the AddMapRoute helpers to an arbitrary endpoint.

```csharp
public static IEndpointConventionBuilder ApplyKestrunConventions(this KestrunHost host, 
    IEndpointConventionBuilder builder, Action<MapRouteOptions> configure)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| host | The Kestrun host used for validation (auth schemes/policies). |
| builder | The endpoint convention builder to decorate. |
| configure | Delegate to configure a fresh [`MapRouteOptions`](../../Kestrun.Hosting.Options/MapRouteOptions) instance. Only applicable properties are honored. |

## Return Value

The original *builder* for fluent chaining.

## Remarks

This is useful when you map endpoints manually via `app.MapGet`/`MapPost` and still want consistent behavior (auth, CORS, rate limiting, antiforgery disable, OpenAPI metadata, short-circuiting) without re-implementing logic. Validation notes: - Pattern, Code are ignored if not relevant. - Authentication schemes and policies are validated against the host registry. - OpenAPI metadata is applied only when non-empty.
