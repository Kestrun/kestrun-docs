# OpenAPIPathMetadata.Callbacks property

A map of possible out-of band callbacks related to the parent operation. The key is a unique identifier for the Callback Object. Each value in the map is a Callback Object that describes a request that may be initiated by the API provider and the expected responses. The key value used to identify the callback object is an expression, evaluated at runtime, that identifies a URL to use for the callback operation.

```csharp
public IDictionary<string, IOpenApiCallback>? Callbacks { get; set; }
```
