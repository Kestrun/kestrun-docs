# ListenerOptions.DisableAltSvcHeader property

Gets or sets a value that controls whether the "Alt-Svc" header is included with response headers. The "Alt-Svc" header is used by clients to upgrade HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 connections to HTTP/3.

The "Alt-Svc" header is automatically included with a response if [`Protocols`](./Protocols) has either HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2 enabled, and HTTP/3 is enabled. If an "Alt-Svc" header value has already been set by the app then it isn't changed.

```csharp
public bool DisableAltSvcHeader { get; set; }
```

## Remarks

Defaults to false.
