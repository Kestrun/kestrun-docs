# OpenApiComponentAnnotationScanner.ScanFromPath method

Scan starting from a main script file path.

```csharp
public static Dictionary<string, AnnotatedVariable> ScanFromPath(string mainPath, 
    IReadOnlyCollection<string>? attributeTypeFilter = null, string componentNameArgument = "Name", 
    int maxFiles = 200)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| mainPath | The main script file path to start scanning from. |
| attributeTypeFilter | Optional filter of attribute type names to include. If null or empty, includes all. |
| componentNameArgument | The name of the attribute argument to use as component name. |
| maxFiles | Maximum number of files to scan to prevent cycles. |

## Return Value

A dictionary keyed by variable name. Each value contains the collected annotations, the declared variable type (if any), and the initializer value/expression (if any).

## Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| InvalidOperationException | Thrown if the maximum number of files is exceeded while following dot-sourced scripts. |

## Remarks

This method performs a breadth-first traversal of the script files starting from mainPath, following dot-sourced includes and extracting attribute annotations that precede variable assignments.
